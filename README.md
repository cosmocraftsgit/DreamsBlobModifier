# Dreams Blob Modifier

Dreams Blob Modier is a fork of apollo specifically designed around the game Dreams. Its mostly a conceptual project of a save data editor more reliable and robust for Dreams than anything out there right now, especially due to Dreams' large savedata structure for encrypting.

# Features

* **Editor right on the hardware itself**
* **Manage save data from across any compatible Dreams version. Including earlier builds with partial importing to retail functoinailty planned.**

## Save Management

* **Save files listing:** quickly move entire local saves from one account to another with ease
* **Game Version information:** view information on what game version the save is from
* **More planned in the future...**

Don't take this project as some crazy serious thing its just conceptual as of now! I do hope for some form of management tool to exist in the future for this game though.
